# facebook-in-bash
A client/server messaging (a la fb messenger) experiment in bash
first is a basic messenger involving clients sending and recieving messages via a server.
second is more involved with same idea as first, but now all runs through the actual local host on the browser, not just the terminal.
second is a work in progress but the concept is there and scripts are written. If you have any insights, feel free to play!
each have their own readMes.
each have their own full multipage write up should more details be desired.
