# facebook-in-bash
A client/server messaging (a la fb messenger) experiment in bash.
Bash_fb is a basic messenger involving clients sending and recieving messages via a server.
Bash_fb_on_localhost is more involved with same idea as first, but now all runs through the actual local host on the browser, not just the terminal.
It is a work in progress but the concept is there and scripts are written. If you have any insights, feel free to play!
Each have their own readMes and
each have their own full multipage write up should more details be desired.
